System README

Overview

This system has been developed using a combination of technologies, including C++, VB.NET, and Electron. It has been converted into an Android native app using specialized software. This Android app provides the optimal way to experience the system's functionality.

Key Features

Multi-Technology Framework:

Core logic in C++.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) implementation in VB.NET.

Cross-platform capabilities via Electron.

Android Native App:

The system has been optimized for use on Android devices through conversion into a native app. For the best user experience, use the Android app version.

Non-Executable Code Base:

The current codebase is not fully executable on local machines. Attempting to run it locally will likely result in errors due to the intricacies of the integrated components and conversion process.

Insertion Code:

The insertion logic is present and written in the system’s source files.

Important Notes

Testing: Use the Android app to test the system’s functionality effectively. Running the source code on other platforms is not recommended.

Miscellaneous Files: While there are additional files included, they are not critical to the system's primary operation and can be ignored.

Usage Instructions

Install the Android app version of the system.

Use the app to explore the features and functionality without worrying about local machine compatibility.

Conclusion

This system showcases a blend of robust technologies and OOP principles. For seamless testing and functionality, we highly recommend relying on the Android native app.

Enjoy using the system!
